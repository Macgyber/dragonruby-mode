# Project Contract — dragonruby-mode

## 1. Purpose (Propósito)
This project exists to help developers understand DragonRuby while writing code in Emacs, by reducing cognitive load, preserving mental context, and increasing the developer’s agency over their tools.

This project prioritizes understanding over automation.

## 2. Core Philosophy
The editor is not just a text editor.
It is a cognitive amplifier.

This project is inspired by the principles articulated by Amir Rajan regarding long-term editor design, developer agency, and extensibility.

The goal is not speed of typing, but clarity of thought.

## 3. What This Project DOES
- Explains DragonRuby concepts in-context while coding.
- Makes implicit engine concepts explicit and visible.
- Provides live, non-intrusive explanations.
- Encourages learning through exposure and repetition.
- Preserves the user’s control and understanding.
- Is designed for long-term use and maintainability.

## 4. What This Project DOES NOT Do
- It does not generate game code automatically.
- It does not hide DragonRuby’s complexity.
- It does not enforce workflows or patterns.
- It does not replace official documentation.
- It does not attempt to be an IDE or a game engine.
- It does not trade clarity for convenience.

## 5. Non-Negotiable Principles
- Everything must be readable.
- Everything must be traceable to source or concept.
- Everything must be extensible by the user.
- No feature may increase cognitive load.
- No feature may obscure how DragonRuby actually works.
- Simplicity is preferred over cleverness.
- Stability is preferred over novelty.

## 6. Design Rules
- Features are expressed as concepts, not magic behaviors.
- Explanations are executable code, not static text.
- Presentation must be non-intrusive.
- The system must be modular and layered.
- No single file may grow beyond clear responsibility.

## 7. Rules for Contributors (Human)
- If a feature does not help the user think more clearly about their code, it does not belong in this project.
- If a feature cannot be explained simply, it is not ready.

## 8. Rules for Contributors (AI)
Any AI-generated contribution must:
- Preserve all existing concepts.
- Avoid introducing opaque abstractions.
- Maintain separation between:
    - concept
    - explanation
    - presentation
- Prefer explicitness over automation.
- Respect backward compatibility.

## 9. Evolution Policy
- The project evolves by adding new concepts, not features.
- Capabilities are composable, never monolithic.
- Backward compatibility is a priority.
- Refactoring is allowed only if clarity improves.

## 10. Success Criteria
This project is successful if:
- Users consult external documentation less often.
- Users understand their own DragonRuby code better.
- Users feel increased control, not dependence.
- The tool fades into the background during flow.

## 11. Long-Term Vision
- This project is intended to remain useful for decades.
- Code should be boring, explicit, and durable.
- The editor should grow with the developer, not replace them.
