* 🌱 Introduction
  This document guards the memory of the universe: the *State* object.
  Without `state`, the game has no past or future, only an eternal present.

* 🧠 Key Concepts
** State
   The dynamic database of your game. DragonRuby saves it automatically.

#+begin_note
**Persistence**: State is saved and loaded automatically by the engine. It is the primary way to maintain continuity between ticks and sessions.
#+end_note

#+begin_quote
“State is the sum of all decisions made.”
#+end_quote

* 🏗 Persistence
** Open Entity
   `args.state` is an "Open Entity" object. You can add any property to it at any time without defining classes.

** Suggested Structure
   - state.player :: Protagonist data.
   - state.score :: Accumulated glory.
   - state.game_over :: The shadow of the end.

* 🧪 Base Code
** Initialization
#+begin_src ruby
def tick args
  args.state.player.x ||= 100
  args.state.player.y ||= 100
end
#+end_src
