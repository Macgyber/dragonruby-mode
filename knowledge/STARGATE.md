# 🌌 Stargate: The Transcendent of Time and Reality

> "We are not merely writing code; we are orchestrating the destiny of a simulation. Stargate is not a debugging tool; it is our will imposed upon the flow of time."

## 🏛️ The Vision: Why does Stargate exist?

In traditional development, an error is the end of the road. In **DragonRuby Mode**, an error is just a divergent branch. 

Stargate is born from the ambition to eliminate the friction between **thought** and **reality**. Our purpose is to turn the simulation into a malleable fabric, where the programmer can travel to the past to correct the present, and project the future without fear of collapse. It is the definitive bridge between the editor's static logic and the engine's heartbeat.

## 🛠️ The Architect's Powers (Commands)

Every Stargate command is a thread connected to the essence of the project. Here is how to exercise your authority over the simulation:

### ⚡ `M-x dragonruby-stargate-enable`
**The Opening of the Portal.** 
Activates the sensor nerves of the plugin. Without this command, Stargate remains dormant. Upon execution, the Kernel seeks the "Dragon's" pulse and synchronizes the clocks of both systems.

### 📜 `M-x stargate-init` (Alias of `dragonruby-stargate-session-init`)
**The chronicler's Genesis.**
Clears all previous history and establishes a new point zero. Use it when you wish to purify the flow of time and begin a new saga of states and seeds.

### 🗺️ `M-x stargate-timeline` (Alias of `dragonruby-stargate-timeline-render`)
**The Vision of Eternity.**
Displays the visual time viewer. It allows you to "scrub" through recorded frames. By selecting an instant, the live simulation will immediately jump to that exact state.

### 💉 `dragonruby-stargate-inject-buffer` (Automatic on Save)
**The Atomic Surgery.**
You don't need manual commands. When you save your code, Stargate injects it directly into the game's brain. If your change is lethal (Gamma), the system will detect the failure and trigger the **Dead Hand Rollback**, returning you to the last stable reality before the disaster occurred.

## 🚑 Critical Performance & Troubleshooting

### 🪚 `M-x dragonruby-kernel-system-halt` (Emergency Exorcism)
**The Ultimate Authority.**
If you experience an exponential rise in CPU usage or the system becomes unstable after a complex reload, execute this command immediately.
- **What it does**: It surgically identifies and terminates ALL active timers, event loops, and background processes of the DragonRuby Mode.
- **Goal**: Returns the CPU to idle (e.g., from 97% to 2%) and purges all zombie states from Emacs memory. 
- **Recovery**: After halting, you can safely re-enable the mode with `M-x dragonruby-stargate-enable`.

## 🚦 Nexus Signals (Mode-line)

- 🌌 **Ecstasy of Synchrony (Bright Blue)**: The portal is open, and time flows safely between Emacs and DragonRuby.
- 💤 **The Dragon's Sleep (Gray)**: Stargate is active, but awaits the awakening of the DragonRuby process to begin recording.
